INSTALL UNDER UNIX

  You need the ocaml compiler installed. It must be accessible in the path.

1. Choose which compilation mode "transitional" or "strict" (see the
   file "MODE") and do either:
     ./configure --transitional
   or:
     ./configure --strict

2. Then, to make everything, do:
     make world.opt

   Faster compilation with option -j (see manual page of 'make', for
   information). For example, if you have 4 cores:
     make -j4 world.opt

    Alternatively, you can decompose the operations into:
       make
    Then, to make camlp5 check itself:
       make bootstrap
    Further, to make the native-code library:
       make opt
    At end, to make more native-code programs:
       make opt.opt

3. Become root and do:
     make install

INSTALL UNDER WINDOWS

  Under Windows, you need the Cygwin environment. The above directives
  apply.
