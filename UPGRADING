Version 1.0

  If your files do not compile, it may be due to the new type 'location'
  which is not abstract. In particular, you can see it as first parameter
  of the exception Exc_located raised by the function Stdpp.raise_with_loc.
  If you handled that exception and looked at the 'location' by considering
  it is a couple of source positions (integer of lex_position), it does not
  work any more.

    Look at the function defined in stdpp.mli.

    To get the first and last positions of a location, use the functions
  Stdpp.first_pos and Stdpp.last_pos. They return integers, which are
  positions in characters from the beginning of the file. But you can
  also get the line number by the function Stdpp.line_nb.
