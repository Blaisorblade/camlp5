<h1 class="top">Extensible grammars</h1>

<p>This chapter describes the whole syntax and semantics of the
extensible grammars of camlp5.</p>

<p>The extensible grammars are the most advanced parsing tool of
camlp5. They apply to streams of characters using a lexer which has to
be previously defined by the programmer. In camlp5, the syntax of the
ocaml language is defined with extensible grammars, which makes camlp5
a bootstrapped system (it compiles its own features by itself).</p>

<div id="tableofcontents">
</div>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>The extensible grammars are a system to build <em>grammar
entries</em> which can be extended dynamically. A grammar entry is an
abstract value internally containing a stream parser. The type of a
grammar entry is <tt>"Grammar.Entry.e t"</tt> where <tt>"t"</tt> is
the type of the values returned by the grammar entry.</p>

<p>To start with extensible grammars, it is necessary to build
a <em>grammar</em>, a value of type "<tt>Grammar.g</tt>", using
the function "<tt>Grammar.gcreate</tt>":</p>

<pre>
  value g = Grammar.gcreate lexer;
</pre>

<p>where "<tt>lexer</tt>" is a lexer previously defined. See the
section explaining the interface with lexers. In a first time, it is
possible to use a lexer of the module "<tt>Plexer</tt>" provided by
camlp5:</p>

<pre>
  value g = Grammar.gcreate (Plexer.gmake ());
</pre>

<p>Each grammar entry is associated with a grammar. Only grammar
entries of the same grammar can call each other. To create a grammar
entry, one has to use the function "<tt>Grammar.Entry.create</tt>" with
takes the grammar as first parameter and a name as second parameter. This
name is used in case of syntax errors. For example:</p>

<pre>
  value exp = Grammar.Entry.create g "expression";
</pre>

<p>To apply a grammar entry, the function
"<tt>Grammar.Entry.parse</tt>" can be used. Its first parameter is the
grammar entry, the second one a stream of characters:</p>

<pre>
  Grammar.Entry.parse exp (Stream.of_string "hello");
</pre>

<p>But if you experiment this, since the entry was just created
without any rules, you receive an error message:</p>

<pre>
  Stream.Error "entry [expression] is empty"
</pre>

<p>To add grammar rules to the grammar entry, it is necessary
to <em>extend</em> it, using a specific syntactic statement:
"<tt>EXTEND</tt>".</p>

<h2>Syntax of the EXTEND statement</h2>

<p>The "<tt>EXTEND</tt>" statement is added in the expressions of the
  ocaml language when the syntax extension kit "<tt>pa_extend.cmo</tt>"
  is loaded. Its syntax is:</p>

<pre>
    expression ::= extend
        extend ::= "EXTEND" extend-body "END"
   extend-body ::= global-opt entries
    global-opt ::= "GLOBAL" ":" entry-names ";"
                 | &lt;nothing&gt;
   entry-names ::= entry-name entry-names
                 | entry-name
         entry ::= entry-name ":" position-opt "[" levels "]"
  position-opt ::= "FIRST"
                 | "LAST"
                 | "BEFORE" label
                 | "AFTER" label
                 | "LEVEL" label
                 | &lt;nothing&gt;
        levels ::= level "|" levels
                 | level
         level ::= label-opt assoc-opt "[" rules "]"
     label-opt ::= label
                 | &lt;nothing&gt;
     assoc-opt ::= "LEFTA"
                 | "RIGHTA"
                 | "NONA"
                 | &lt;nothing&gt;
         rules ::= rule "|" rules
                 | rule
          rule ::= psymbols-opt "->" expression
                 | psymbols-opt
  psymbols-opt ::= psymbols
                 | &lt;nothing&gt;
      psymbols ::= psymbol ";" psymbols
                 | psymbol
       psymbol ::= symbol
                 | pattern "=" symbol
        symbol ::= keyword
                 | token
                 | token string
                 | entry-name
                 | entry-name "LEVEL" label
                 | "SELF"
                 | "NEXT"
                 | "LIST0" symbol
                 | "LIST0" symbol "SEP" symbol
                 | "LIST1" symbol
                 | "LIST1" symbol "SEP" symbol
                 | "OPT" symbol
                 | "[" rules "]"
                 | "(" symbol ")"
       keyword ::= string
         token ::= uident
         label ::= string
    entry-name ::= qualid
        qualid ::= qualid "." qualid
                 | uident
                 | lident
        uident ::= 'A'-'Z' ident
        lident ::= ('a'-'z' | '_' | utf8-char) ident
         ident ::= ident-char*
    ident-char ::= ('a'-'a' | 'A'-'Z' | '0'-'9' | '_' | ''' | utf8-char)
     utf8-char ::= '\128'-'\255'
</pre>

<p>Other statements, "<tt>GEXTEND</tt>", "<tt>DELETE_RULE</tt>",
  "<tt>GDELETE_RULE</tt>" are also defined by the same syntax extension
  kit. See further.</p>

<p>In the description above, ony "<tt>EXTEND</tt>" and "<tt>END</tt>"
  are new keywords (reserved words which cannot be used in variables,
  constructors or module names). The other strings
  (e.g. "<tt>GLOBAL</tt>", "<tt>LEVEL</tt>", "<tt>LIST0</tt>",
  "<tt>LEFTA</tt>", etc.) are not reserved.</p>

<h2>Semantics of the EXTEND statement</h2>

<p>The EXTEND statement starts with the "<tt>EXTEND</tt>" keyword and ends
  with the "<tt>END</tt>" keyword.</p>

<h3>GLOBAL indicator</h3>

<p>After the first keyword, it is possible to see the identifier
"<tt>GLOBAL</tt>" followed by a colon, a list of entries names and a
semicolon. It says that these entries correspond to visible
(previously defined) entry variables, in the context of the EXTEND
statement, the other ones being locally and silently defined
inside.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If an entry, which is extended in the EXTEND statement, is in the
    GLOBAL list, but is not defined in the context of the EXTEND
    statement, the ocaml compiler will fail with the error "unbound
    value".</li>
  <li>If there is no GLOBAL indicator, and an entry, which is extended
    in the EXTEND statement, is not defined in the contex of the EXTEND
    statement, the ocaml compiler will also fail with the error "unbound
    value".</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
  value exp = Grammar.Entry.create g "exp";
  EXTEND
    GLOBAL: exp;
    exp: [ [ x = foo; y = bar ] ];
    foo: [ [ "foo" ] ];
    bar: [ [ "bar" ] ];
  END;
</pre>

<p>The entry "exp" is an existing variable (defined by value exp =
...). On the other hand, the entries "foo" and "bar" have not been
defined. Because of the GLOBAL indicator, the system define them
locally.</p>

<p>Without the GLOBAL indicator, the three entries would have been
considered as global variables, therefore the ocaml compiler would
say "unbound variable" under the first undefined entry, "foo".</p>

<h3>Entries list</h3>

<p>Then the list of entries extensions follow. An entry extension
starts with the entry name followed by a colon. An entry may have
several levels corresponding to several stream parsers which call the
ones the others (see further).</p>

<h4>Optional position</h4>

<p>After the colon, it is possible to specify a where to insert the
defined levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The identifier "<tt>FIRST</tt>" (resp. "<tt>LAST</tt>")
    indicates that the level must be inserted before (resp. after) all
    possibly existing levels of the entry. They become their first
    (resp. last) levels.</li>
  <li>The identifier "<tt>BEFORE</tt>" (resp. "<tt>AFTER</tt>")
    followed by a level label (a string) indicates that the levels
    must be inserted before (resp. after) that level, if it exists. If
    it does not exist, the extend statement fails at run time.</li>
  <li>The identifier "<tt>LEVEL</tt>" followed by a level label
    indicates that the first level defined in the extend statement
    must be inserted at the given level, extending and modifying
    it. The other levels defined in the statement are inserted after
    this level, and before the possible levels following this
    level. If there is no level with this label, the extend statement
    fails at run time.</li>
  <li>By default, if the entry has no level, the levels defined in the
    statement are inserted in the entry. Otherwise the first defined
    level is inserted at the first level of the entry, extending or
    modifying it. The other levels are inserted afterwards (before the
    possible second level which may previously exist in the entry).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Levels</h4>

<p>After the optional "position", the <em>level</em> list follow. The
levels are separated by vertical bars, the whole list being between
brackets.</p>

<p>A level starts with an optional label, which corresponds to its name.
This label is useful to specify this level in case of future extension,
using the <em>position</em> (see previous section).</p>

<p>The level continues with an optional associativity indicator, which
can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>LEFTA for left associativity (default),</li>
  <li>RIGHTA for right associativity,</li>
  <li>NONA for no associativity.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rules</h4>

<p>At last, the grammar <em>rule</em> list appear. The rules are
separated by vertical bars, the whole list being brackets.</p>

<p>A rule looks like a match case in the "<tt>match</tt>" statement or
a parser case in the "<tt>parser</tt>" statement: a list of psymbols
(see next paragraph) separated by semicolons, followed by a right
arrow and an expression, the semantic action. Actually, the right
arrow and expression are optional: in this case, it is equivalent to
an expression which would be the unit "<tt>()</tt>" constructor.</p>

<p>A psymbol is either a pattern, followed with the equal sign and a
symbol, or by a symbol alone. It corresponds to a test of this symbol,
whose value is bound to the pattern if any.</p>

<h4>Symbols</h4>

<p>A symbol is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a keyword (a string): the input must match this keyword,</li>
  <li>a token name (an identifier starting with an uppercase
    character), optionally followed by a string: the input must match
    this token (any value if no string, or that string if a string
    follows the token name), the list of the available tokens
    depending on the associated lexer (the list of tokens available
    with "Plexer.gmake ()" is: LIDENT, UIDENT, TILDEIDENT,
    TILDEIDENTCOLON, QUESTIONIDENT, INT, INT_l, INT_L, INT_n, FLOAT,
    CHAR, STRING, QUOTATION, ANTIQUOT and EOI; other lexers may
    propose other lists of tokens),
</li>
  <li>an entry name, which correspond to a call to this entry,</li>
  <li>an entry name followed by the identifier "<tt>LEVEL</tt>" and a
    level label, which correspond to the call to this entry at that
    level,</li>
  <li>the identifier "<tt>SELF</tt>" which is a recursive call to the
    present entry, according to the associativity (i.e. it may be a
    call at the current level, to the next level, or to the top level
    of the entry): "<tt>SELF</tt>" is equivalent to the name of the
    entry itself,</li>
  <li>the identifier "<tt>NEXT</tt>", which is a call to the next level
    of the current entry,</li>
  <li>a left brace, followed by a list of rules separated by vertical
    bars, and a right brace: equivalent to a call to an entry, with
    these rules, inlined,</li>
  <li>a meta symbol (see further),</li>
  <li>a symbol between parentheses.</li>
</ul>

<p>The syntactic analysis follow the list of symbols. If it fails,
depending on the first items of the rule (see the section about the
kind of grammars recognized):</p>

<ul>
  <li>the parsing may fail by raising the exception
    "<tt>Stream.Error</tt>"</li>
  <li>the parsing may continue with the next rule.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Meta symbols</h4>

<p>Extra symbols exist, allowing to manipulate lists or optional
symbols. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>LIST0 followed by a symbol: this is a list of this symbol,
    possibly empty,</li>
  <li>LIST0 followed by a symbol, SEP and another symbol: this is a
    list, possibly empty, of the first symbol separated by the second
    one,</li>
  <li>LIST1 followed by a symbol: this is a list of this symbol,
    with at least one element,</li>
  <li>LIST0 followed by a symbol, SEP and another symbol: this is a
    list, with at least one element, of the first symbol separated by
    the second one,</li>
  <li>OPT followed by a symbol: equivalent to "this symbol or
    nothing".</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rules insertion</h3>

<p>Remember that "<tt>EXTEND</tt>" is a statement, not a declaration:
the rules are added in the entries at run time. Each rule is
internally inserted in a tree, allowing the left factorization of the
rule. For example, with this list of rules (borrowed from the camlp5
sources):</p>

<pre>
  "method"; "private"; "virtual"; l = label; ":"; t = poly_type
  "method"; "virtual"; "private"; l = label; ":"; t = poly_type
  "method"; "virtual"; l = label; ":"; t = poly_type
  "method"; "private"; l = label; ":"; t = poly_type; "="; e = expr
  "method"; "private"; l = label; sb = fun_binding
  "method"; l = label; ":"; t = poly_type; "="; e = expr
  "method"; l = label; sb = fun_binding
</pre>

<p>the rules are inserted in a tree and the result looks like:</p>

<pre>
  "method"
     |-- "private"
     |       |-- "virtual"
     |       |       |-- label
     |       |             |-- ":"
     |       |                  |-- poly_type
     |       |-- label
     |             |-- ":"
     |             |    |-- poly_type
     |             |            |-- ":="
     |             |                 |-- expr
     |             |-- fun_binding
     |-- "virtual"
     |       |-- "private"
     |       |       |-- label
     |       |             |-- ":"
     |       |                  |-- poly_type
     |       |-- label
     |             |-- ":"
     |                  |-- poly_type
     |-- label
           |-- ":"
           |    |-- poly_type
           |            |-- "="
           |                 |-- expr
           |-- fun_binding
</pre>

<p>This tree is built as long as rules are inserted. When used, by
applying the function "<tt>Grammar.Entry.parse</tt>" to the current
entry, the input is matched with that tree, starting from the tree
root, descending on it as long as the parsing advances.</p>

<p>There is a different tree by entry level.</p>

<h3>Semantic action</h3>

<p>The semantic action, i.e. the expression following the right arrow
in rules, contain in its environment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the variables bound by the patterns of the symbols found in the
    rules,</li>
  <li>the specific variable "<tt>loc</tt>" which contain the location
    of the whole rule in the source.</li>
</ul>

<p>The location is an abstract type defined in the module
"<tt>Stdpp</tt>" of camlp5.</p>

<p>It is possible to change the name of this variable by using the option
"<tt>-loc</tt>" of camlp5. For example, compiling a file like this:</p>

<pre>
  camlp5r -loc foobar file.ml
</pre>

<p>the variable name, for the location will be "<tt>foobar</tt>"
instead of "<tt>loc</tt>".</p>

<h2>The DELETE_RULE statement</h2>

<p>The "<tt>DELETE_RULE</tt>" statement is also added in the
  expressions of the ocaml language when the syntax extension kit
  "<tt>pa_extend.cmo</tt>" is loaded. Its syntax is:</p>

<pre>
        expression ::= delete-rule
       delete-rule ::= "DELETE_RULE" delete-rule-body "END"
  delete-rule-body ::= entry-name ":" symbols
           symbols ::= symbol symbols
                     | &lt;nothing&gt;
</pre>

<p>See the syntax of the EXTEND statement for the meaning of the syntax
  entries not defined above.</p>

<p>The entry is scanned for a rule matching the giving symbol
  list. When found, the rule is removed. If no rule is found, the
  exception "<tt>Not_found</tt>" is raised.</p>

<h2>Machinery</h2>

<p>Each entry level contains internally two trees:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A tree of the rules starting with the current entry name or by
    the identifier "<tt>SELF</tt>",</li>
  <li>A tree of the rules <em>not</em> starting with the current entry
    name nor by "<tt>SELF</tt>".</li>
</ul>

<h2>Kind of grammar</h2>

<p>... to be completed ...</p>

<h2>Interface with the lexer</h2>

<p>To create a grammar, the function "<tt>Grammar.gcreate</tt>" must
  be called, with a lexer as parameter.</p>

<p>A simple solution, as possible lexer, is the predefined lexer built
  by "<tt>Plexer.gmake ()</tt>", lexer used for the ocaml grammar of
  camlp5. In this case, you can just put it as parameter of
  "<tt>Grammar.gcreate</tt>" and it is not necessary to read this
  section.</p>

<p>The section first introduces the notion of "token patterns" which
  are the way the tokens and keywords symbols in the EXTEND statement
  are represented. Then follow the description of the type of the
  parameter of "<tt>Grammar.gcreate</tt>".

<h3>Token patterns</h3>

<p>A token pattern is a value of the type defined like this:</p>

<pre>
  type pattern = (string * string);
</pre>

<p>This type represents values of the token and keywords symbols in
  the grammar rules.</p>

<p>For a token symbol in the grammar rules, the first string is the
  token constructor name (starting with an uppercase character), the
  second string indicates whether the match is "any" (the empty
  string) or some specific value of the token (an non-empty
  string).</p>

<p>For a keyword symbol, the first string is empty and the second
  string is the keyword itself.</p>

<p>For example, given this grammar rule:</p>

<pre>
  "for"; i = LIDENT; "="; e1 = SELF; "to"; e2 = SELF
</pre>

<p>the different symbols and keywords are represented by the following
  couples of strings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the keyword "for" is represented by <tt>("", "for")</tt>,</li>
  <li>the keyword "=" by <tt>("", "=")</tt>,</li>
  <li>the keyword "to" by <tt>("", "to")</tt>),</li>
  <li>and the token symbol <tt>LIDENT</tt> by <tt>("LIDENT", "")</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The symbol <tt>UIDENT "Foo"</tt> in a rule would be represented
  by the token pattern:</p>

<pre>
  ("UIDENT", "Foo")
</pre>

<p>Notice that the symbol "<tt>SELF</tt>" is a specific symbol of the
  EXTEND syntax: it does not correspond to a token pattern and is
  represented differently. A token constructor name must not belong to
  the specific symbols: SELF, NEXT, LIST0, LIST1 and OPT.</p>

<h3>The glexer record</h3>

<p>The type of the parameter of the function "<tt>Grammar.gcreate</tt>"
  is "<tt>glexer</tt>", defined in the module "<tt>Token</tt>". It is
  a record type with the following fields:</p>

<h4><tt>tok_func</tt></h4>

<p>It is the lexer itself. Its type is:</p>

<pre>
  Stream.t char -> (Stream.t (string * string) * location_function);
</pre>

<p>The lexer takes a character stream as parameter and must answer a
  couple of: a token stream, the tokens being represented by a couple
  of strings, and a location function.</p>

<p>The location function is a function taking, as parameter, a integer
  corresponding to a token number in the stream (starting from zero),
  and returning the location of this token in the source. It is
  important to get the good locations in the semantic actions of the
  grammar rules.</p>

<p>Notice that, despite the lexer takes a character stream as
  parameter, it is not mandatory to use the stream parsers technology
  to write the lexer. What is important is that it does the job.</p>

<h4><tt>tok_using</tt></h4>

<p>It is a function of type:</p>

<pre>
  pattern -> unit
</pre>

<p>The parameter of this function is the representation of a token
  symbol or a keyword symbol in grammar rules. See the section about
  token patterns.</p>

<p>This function is called for each token symbol and each keyword
  encountered in the grammar rules of the EXTEND statement. Its goal
  is to allow the lexer to check that the tokens and keywords do
  respect the lexer rules. It checks that the tokens exist and are not
  mispelled. It can be also used to enter the keywords in the lexer
  keyword tables.</p>

<p>Setting it as the function that does nothing is possible, but the
  check of correctness of tokens is not done.</p>

<p>In case or error, the function must raise the exception
  "<tt>Token.Error</tt>" with an error message as parameter.</p>

<h4><tt>tok_removing</tt></h4>

<p>It is a function of type:</p>

<pre>
  pattern -> unit
</pre>

<p>It is called by the DELETE_RULE statement for each token symbol and
  each keyword that an occurence of them is no more used. This can be
  interesting for keywords, if the lexer record the number of
  occurences of the keywords: when the number of occurences falls to
  zero, the keyword can be removed from the lexer tables.</p>

<h4><tt>tok_match</tt></h4>

<p>It is a function of type:</p>

<pre>
  pattern -> ((string * string) -> unit)
</pre>

<p>The function tells how a token of the input stream is matched
  against a token pattern. Both are represented by a couple of
  strings.</p>

<p>This function takes a token pattern as parameter and return a
  function matching a token, returning the matched string or raising
  the exception "<tt>Stream.Failure</tt>" if the token does not
  match.</p>

<p>Notice that, for efficiency, it is necessary to write this function
  as a match of token patterns returning, for each case, the function
  which matches the token, <em>not</em> a function matching the token
  pattern and the token together and returning a string for each
  case.</p>

<p>An acceptable function is provided in the module "Token" and is
  named "default_match". Its code looks like this:</p>

<pre>
  value default_match =
    fun
    [ (p_con, "") ->
        fun (con, prm) -> if con = p_con then prm else raise Stream.Failure
    | (p_con, p_prm) ->
        fun (con, prm) ->
          if con = p_con && prm = p_prm then prm else raise Stream.Failure ]
  ;
</pre>

<h4><tt>tok_text</tt></h4>

<p>It is a function of type:</p>

<pre>
  pattern -> string
</pre>

<p>Destinated to error messages, it takes a token pattern as parameter
  and return the string giving its name.</p>

<p>It is possible to use the predefined function "<tt>lexer_text</tt>"
  of the Token module. This function just returns the name of the
  token pattern constructor and its parameter if any.</p>

<p>For example, with this default function, the token symbol IDENT
  would be written as IDENT in error message (e.g. "IDENT expected").
  The "text" function may decide to print it differently, e.g., as
  "identifier".</p>

<h4><tt>tok_comm</tt></h4>

<p>It is a mutable field of type:</p>

<pre>
  option (list location)
</pre>

<p>It asks the lexer (the lexer function should do it) to record the
  locations of the comments in the program. Setting this field to
  "None" indicates that the lexer must not record them. Setting it to
  "Some []" indicated that the lexer must put the comments location
  list in the field, which is mutable.</p>

<h3>Minimalist version</h3>

<p>If a lexer have been written, named "<tt>lexer</tt>", here is the
  minimalist version of the value suitable as parameter to
  "<tt>Grammar.gcreate</tt>":</p>

<pre>
  {Token.tok_func = lexer;
   Token.tok_using _ = (); Token.tok_removing _ = ();
   Token.tok_match = Token.default_match;
   Token.tok_text = Token.lexer_text;
   Token.tok_comm = None}
</pre>

<h2>Functorial interface</h2>

<p>The normal interface for grammars described in the previous sections
  has two drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, there is no static control that, when an entry calls
    another entry, this other entry is compatible, i.e. comes from the
    same grammar. This check is only done at run time.</p>
  <li>Second, the entries are called with a character stream as
    parameter. Internally, this character stream is transformed into a
    token stream. It is therefore not always possible to call an entry
    several times, because a token may have been unfrozen but not
    consumed in the stream, causing it to be lost in the second
    call. Actually, it may work or not depending on the grammar.</li>
</ul>

<p>To illustrate this second problem, let us take an example.</p>
