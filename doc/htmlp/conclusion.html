<h1 class="top">Future work</h1>

<p>Just some ideas... All these extensions will be done if there are
  good basic ideas for their implementations.</p>

<h2>extensible syntax tree quotations</h2>

<p>A new implementation of quotation for <a href="ml_ast.html">syntax
  trees</a> allowing to use the user current syntax (his extensions
  included) was tested some time ago, but the result was not 100%
  satisfactory. Several implementations are possible, and
  compatibility with previous versions and user programs is a
  problem. We are continuing thinking of it.</p>

<h2>pretty print in shorter syntax</h2>

<p>It is also planed to improve the <a href="pretty.html">pretty
    printing</a> system and the <a href="printers.html">printers</a>,
  so that the management of the lines (indentation, continuations)
  be handled by the system. For the moment, the programmer has to
  manage them using the "<tt>pc</tt>" variable.</p>

<h2>extensible lexers</h2>

<p>Extensible <a href="lexers.html">lexers</a> would be a interesting
  extension, also. And possibly lexers using regular expressions
  (extensible if possible, otherwise as a different module).</p>

<h2>utf-8</h2>

<p>The camlp5 lexer for ocaml programs (module Plexer) allows utf-8
  characters. Since utf-8 seems to have some success among unicode
  formats, perhaps a reflexion to add greek characters and/or real
  utf-8 arrows in the syntax (in particular in types) could be
  interesting.</p>
