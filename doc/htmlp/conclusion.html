<h1 class="top">Future work</h1>

<p>Just some ideas... things to implement or to think about...</p>

<h2>pretty print in shorter syntax</h2>

<p>It is planned to improve the <a href="pretty.html">pretty
    printing</a> system and the <a href="printers.html">printers</a>,
  so that the management of the lines (indentation, continuations)
  are automatically handled by the system. For the moment, the programmer must
  explicitly manage them using the "<tt>pc</tt>" variable.</p>

<h2>printer for EXTEND_PRINTER</h2>

<p>There is a syntax "<tt>EXTEND_PRINTER</tt>" but the corresponding
  printer is missing.</p>

<h2>extensible lexers</h2>

<p>Extensible <a href="lexers.html">lexers</a> would be an interesting
  extension. And possibly lexers using regular expressions
  (extensible if possible, otherwise as a different module).</p>

<h2>utf-8</h2>

<p>The Camlp5 lexer for OCaml programs (module Plexer) allows utf-8
  characters. Since utf-8 seems to have some success among unicode
  formats, perhaps a reflection to add greek characters and/or real
  utf-8 arrows in the syntax (in particular in types) would be
  interesting.</p>
