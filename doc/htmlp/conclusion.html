<h1 class="top">Future work</h1>

<p>Just some ideas... things to implement or to thing about...</p>

<h2>pretty print in shorter syntax</h2>

<p>It is also planed to improve the <a href="pretty.html">pretty
    printing</a> system and the <a href="printers.html">printers</a>,
  so that the management of the lines (indentation, continuations)
  be handled by the system. For the moment, the programmer has to
  manage them using the "<tt>pc</tt>" variable.</p>

<h2>rewritting pretty printer in Scheme syntax</h2>

<p>The pretty printer kit "<tt>pr_scheme.cmo</tt>" still uses an old
  technology of pretty printing using old module named
  "<tt>Spretty</tt>". I has to be rewritten using
  <a href="printers.html">EXTEND_PRINTER</a> and the
  module <a href="pretty.html">Pretty</a>.</p>

<h2>printer for EXTEND_PRINTER</h2>

<p>There is a syntax "<tt>EXTEND_PRINTER</tt>" but the corresponding
  printer is missing.</p>

<h2>extensible lexers</h2>

<p>Extensible <a href="lexers.html">lexers</a> would be a interesting
  extension, also. And possibly lexers using regular expressions
  (extensible if possible, otherwise as a different module).</p>

<h2>utf-8</h2>

<p>The Camlp5 lexer for OCaml programs (module Plexer) allows utf-8
  characters. Since utf-8 seems to have some success among unicode
  formats, perhaps a reflexion to add greek characters and/or real
  utf-8 arrows in the syntax (in particular in types) could be
  interesting.</p>
