<h1 class="top">Parsing and Printing tools</h1>

<p>Camlp5 provides two parsing tools:</p>

<ul>
<li>stream parsers</li>
<li>extensible grammars</li>
</ul>

<p>The first parsing tool, the stream parsers, is the elementary
  system. It is pure syntactic sugar, i.e. the code is directly
  converted into basic OCaml statements: essentially functions,
  pattern matchings, try. A stream parser is just a function. But the
  system does not manage associativity, nor parsing level. Left
  recursion results on infinite loops, just like functions whose first
  action would be a call to itself.</p>

<p>The second parsing tool, the extensible grammars, are more
  sophisticated. A grammar written with them is more readable, and
  look like grammars written with tools like "yacc". They take care of
  associativity, left recursion, and level of parsing. They are
  dynamically extensible, what allows the syntax extensions what
  Camlp5 provides for OCaml syntax.</p>

<p>In both cases, the input data are streams.</p>

<p>Camlp5 also provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a pretty printing module</li>
  <li>extensible printers</li>
</ul>

<p>The next sections give an overview of the parsing and printing
  tools.</p>

<h2>Stream parsers</h2>

<p>The stream parsers is a system of recursive descendant
  parsing. Streams are actually lazy lists. At each step, the head of
  the list is compared against a <em>stream pattern</em>. There are
  two kinds of streams parsers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The imperative <a href="parsers.html">streams parsers</a>, where
    the elements are removed from the stream as long as they are
    parsed.  Parsers return either:
    <ul>
      <li>A value, in case of success,</li>
      <li>The exception "<tt>Stream.Failure</tt>" when the parser does
        not apply and no elements have been removed from the stream,
        indicating that, possibly, other parsers may apply,</li>
      <li>The exception "<tt>Stream.Error</tt>" when the parser does
        not apply, but one or several elements have been removed from
        the stream, indicating that nothing can to be done to make up
        the error.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The purely <a href="fparsers.html">functional stream parsers</a>
    where the elements are not removed from the stream during the
    parsing. These parsers return a value of type "option", i.e
    either:
    <ul>
      <li>"Some" a value and the remaining stream, in case of
        success,</li>
      <li>"None", in case of failure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The differences are about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="u">Syntax errors</span>: in the imperative version,
    the location of the error is clear, it is at the current position
    of the stream, and the system allows to provide a specific error
    message (typically, that some "element" was "expected"). On the
    other hand, in the functional version, the position is not clear
    since it returns nothing and the initial stream is unaffected. The
    only solution to know where the error happened is to analyze that
    stream to see how many elements have be unfrozen. No clear error
    message is available, just "syntax error" (but this could be
    improved).</li>
  <li><span class="u">Power</span>: in the imperative version, when a
    rule raises the exception "<tt>Stream.Error</tt>", the parsing
    cannot continue.  In the functional version, the parsing can
    continue by analyzing the next rule with the initial unaffected
    stream: this is a
    <em>limited backtrack</em>.</li>
  <li><span class="u">Neatness</span>: functional streams are neater,
    just like functional programming is neater than imperative
    programming.</li>
</ul>

<p>The imperative parsers implement what is called "predictive
  parsing", i.e. recursive descendant parsing without backtrack.</p>

<p>In the imperative version, there exists also
  <a href="lexers.html">lexers</a>, a shorter syntax when the stream
  elements are of the specific type '<tt>char</tt>'.</p>

<h2>Extensible grammars</h2>

<p>Extensible grammars manipulate <em>grammar entries</em>. Grammar
  entries are abstract values internally containing mutable stream
  parsers. When a grammar entry is created, its internal parser is
  empty, i.e. it always fails when used. A specific syntactic
  construction, with the keyword "<tt>EXTEND</tt>" allows to extend
  grammar entries with new grammar rules.</p>

<p>In opposition to stream parsers, grammar entries manage
  associativity, left factorization, and levels. Moreover, these
  grammars allows to define optional calls, lists and lists with
  separators. However, they are not functions and cannot have
  parameters.</p>

<p>Since the internal system is stream parsers, extensible grammars
  use recursive descendant parsing.</p>

<p>The parsers of the OCaml language in Camlp5 are written with
  extensible grammars.</p>

<h2>Pretty module</h2>

<p>The "<tt>Pretty</tt>" module is an original tool allowing to
  control the displaying of lines. The user has to specify two functions
  where:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the data is printed in one only line</li>
  <li>the data is printed in several lines</li>
</ul>

<p>The system first tries the first function. At any time, it the line
  overflows, i.e. if its size is greater than some "line length"
  specified in the module interface, or if it contains newlines, the
  function is aborted and control is given to the second function.</p>

<p>This is a basic, but powerful, system. It supposes that the programmer
  takes care of the current indentation, and the beginning and the end of
  its lines.</p>

<p>The module will be extended in the future to hide the management of
  indendations and line continuations, and by the supply of functions
  combinating the two cases above, in which the programmer can specify
  the possible places where newlines can be inserted.</p>

<h2>Extensible printers</h2>

<p>The extensible printers are symmetric to the extensible grammars.
  The extensible grammars take syntax rules and return syntax trees.
  The extensible printers are actually extensible functions taking
  syntax trees as parameters and returning the pretty printed
  statements in strings.</p>

<p>The extensible printers can have printing levels, just like
  grammars have parsing levels, and it is possible to take the
  associativity into account by provided functions to call either the
  current level or the next level.</p>

<p>The printers of the OCaml language are written with extensible
  printers.</p>
