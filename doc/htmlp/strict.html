<h1 class="top">Transitional and Strict modes</h1>

<p>Since version 4.09, Camlp5 can be installed in two
  modes: <em>transitional</em> mode and <em>strict</em> mode.</p>

<p>This notion has been introduced to ensure backward compatibility
  and allow the use of a new quotation kit "<tt>q_ast.cmo</tt>",
  defining Camlp5 syntax tree quotations in user syntax (with all its
  possible extensions).</p>

<p>Here are the differences with the two modes:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Transitional</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt>Compatibility</dt>
      <dd>The syntax tree is fully compatible with the previous
        versions of Camlp5, no changes has to be done in users'
        programs.</dd>
      <dt>Quotation kit "<tt>q_ast.cmo</tt>"</dt>
      <dd>The antiquotations are not available: when used, a syntax
        error message is displayed.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt>Strict</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt>Compatibility</dt>
      <dd>The syntax tree is different, users' programs may have to be
        modified, but not necessarily.</dd>
      <dt>Quotation kit "<tt>q_ast.cmo</tt>"</dt>
      <dd>All antiquotations are available.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>In strict mode, better compatibility is assumed in programs using
  syntax tree quotations instead of syntax tree nodes. A solution is
  therefore to use strict mode and change the usage of nodes into the
  usage of quotations (which is backward compatible). But there may
  exist other incompatibilities.<p>

<h2>Which mode is installed ?</h2>

<p>To know in which mode an installed version of Camlp5 is installed,
  type:</p>

<pre>
  camlp5 -pmode
</pre>

<h2>Selecting mode when compiling Camlp5</h2>

<p>When compiling Camlp5 from its sources, the mode must be selected
  at configuration time, before doing anything else. The <em>configure</em>
  must be run with one of these options:</p>

<pre>
  ./configure -strict
  ./configure -transitional
</pre>

<p>The default is "transitional", i.e. without option, the sources are
  compiled in transitional mode.</p>
