<h1 class="top">Transitional and Strict modes</h1>

<p>Since version 4.09, Camlp5 has been able to be installed in two
  modes: the <em>transitional</em> mode and the <em>strict</em>
  mode. When Camlp5 is installed, it works with one only of these
  modes (the two modes contain indeed different definitions of some
  interfaces and are incompatible the one to the other). The user has
  to choose in which mode he wants to use Camlp5.</p>

<p>This notion has been introduced to ensure backward compatibility of
  the Camlp5 syntax tree, together with the usage of a new quotation
  kit "<tt>q_ast.cmo</tt>", which allows to use Camlp5 syntax tree
  quotations in user syntax (with all its possible extensions).</p>

<dl style="font-size:80%; font-style:oblique">
  <dt>A short example of these syntax tree quotations:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If the syntax of the <a href="grammars.html">extensible
        grammars</a> has been added, it is possible to write things
      like:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;:expr&lt; EXTEND a: [ [ c = d -> $e$ ] ]; END >>;
</pre>
    <p>representing the syntax tree of this statement: this is not
      possible with the classical quotation kit "<tt>q_MLast.cmo</tt>"
      because all quotations must be there only
      in <a href="revsynt.html">revised syntax</a> and without syntax
      extensions.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Here are the differences between the two modes:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Transitional</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt>Compatibility</dt>
      <dd>The syntax tree is fully compatible with the previous
        versions of Camlp5, no changes has to be done in users'
        programs.</dd>
      <dt>Quotation kit "<tt>q_ast.cmo</tt>"</dt>
      <dd>The antiquotations are not available: when used, a syntax
        error message is displayed.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt>Strict</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt>Compatibility</dt>
      <dd>The syntax tree is different, users' programs may have to be
        modified, but not necessarily.</dd>
      <dt>Quotation kit "<tt>q_ast.cmo</tt>"</dt>
      <dd>All antiquotations are available.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>In strict mode, better compatibility is assumed in programs using
  syntax tree quotations instead of syntax tree nodes. A solution is
  therefore to use strict mode and change the usage of nodes into the
  usage of quotations (which is backward compatible). But there may
  exist other incompatibilities.<p>

<h2>Which mode is installed ?</h2>

<p>To know in which mode an installed version of Camlp5 is installed,
  type:</p>

<pre>
  camlp5 -pmode
</pre>

<h2>Selecting mode when compiling Camlp5</h2>

<p>When compiling Camlp5 from its sources, the mode must be selected
  at configuration time, before doing anything else. The <em>configure</em>
  must be run with one of these options:</p>

<pre>
  ./configure -strict
  ./configure -transitional
</pre>

<p>The default is "transitional", i.e. without option, the sources are
  compiled in transitional mode.</p>
