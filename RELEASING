HOW TO MAKE A RELEASE (WHEN YOU ARE ADMINISTRATOR).

1. Do a "make".
2. Check that cold sources are bootstrapped: "make compare_sources"
   If not ok, see how to update them in Camlp5 doc, chap "camlp5 sources".
   Probably "make bootstrap_sources" makes the job.
3. Edit main/pcaml.ml and change version name. In general, it suffices
   to remove "-exp" (changing e.g. "7.09-exp" by just "7.09").
4. Do the same thing in file ocaml_src/main/pcaml.ml (cold source).
5. Edit file README.md, also update version number.
6. Commit and push in github, commenting "Preparing for release #version."
   where "#version" is the version number.
7. Do a tag by typing "git tag relv" where "v" is the release number
   with only the digits (e.g. 709 if release is 7.09, resulting rel709).
8. Push tags by taping "git push --tags".
9. Check if present in github camlp5/camlp5 "release".

Then go to cloned directory camlp5.github.io and

1. Copy CHANGES from camlp5 into CHANGES.txt
2. Copy README.md from camlp5.
3. Edit file index.html, change the version number, the release date
   and the tar.gz link and name.
4. Commit and push. After some minutes, the home dir of camlp5
      https://camlp5.github.io/
   should be done

AFTER THE RELEASE

1. Edit files main/pcaml.ml, ocaml_src/main/pcaml.ml and README.md to
   reflect new preparing version, changing, e.g. "7.09" into "7.10-exp"
   in these three files.
2. Edit CHANGES to add new title for new version, e.g.
      Camlp5 Version 7.10:
      --------------------
3. Push and commit with comment
    "Starting version 7.10-exp after release 7.09."
