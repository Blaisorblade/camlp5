       in the context of the [horiz] function of the function [horiz_vertic]
       of the module Printing, and if the line overflows or contains newlines,
       the function fails (the exception is catched by [horiz_vertic] for
       a vertical pretty print). *)

       as far as possible. When an element does not fit on the line, a
       newline is added and the element is displayed in the next line with
       an indentation of [sh]. [elem] is the function to print elements,
       [el] a list of pairs (element * separator) (the last separator is
       ignored). *)

       [plist elem sh pc el] returns the pretty printed string of
       the list of elements, like with [plist] but the value of
       [pc.bef] corresponds to an element already printed, as it were
       on the list. Therefore, if the first element of [el] does not fit
       in the line, a newline and a tabulation is added after [pc.bef]. *)

       If that list contains expressions of the form let..in sequence, this
       sub-sequence is also flattened with the let..in spplies only to the
       first expression of the sequence. If [e] is a let..in sequence, it
       works the same way. If [e] is not a sequence nor a let..in sequence,
