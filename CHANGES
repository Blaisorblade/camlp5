Camlp4s Version 1.0:
--------------------

* [16 Dec 06] Added ability to add directives: "Pcaml.add_directive".
  Added "pa_pragma.cmo" which add directive "#pragma". Parameter evaluated
  in the context of the preprocessor (e.g. for a syntax extension).

* [05 Dec 06] Fixed old bug: "camlp4 foo/bar.cmo" now searchs from the
  current directory (i.e in its subdirectory "foo"), instead of searching
  in the path. Before, we had to write "camlp4 ./foo/bar.cmo".

* [01 Dec 06] In "pa_macro.cmo", the expression after IFDEF can use
  the infix operators OR and AND, the prefix one NOT and expressions
  between parentheses.

* [01 Dec 06] The same distribution can compile with several versions
  of OCaml. After "./configure", the good version of OCaml interfaces
  are selected.

* [01 Dec 06] The type "location" is now abstract. Defined in stdpp.mli.

* [01 Dec 06] First distributed version; started from old camlp4
  version 3.06 and updated.
